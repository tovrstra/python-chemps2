How to build and install

1) First build and install the CheMPS2 shared object. This should result in
   a file libchemps2.so and the chemps2 include files somewhere on your system.

2) Set environment variables properly

   * If libchemps2.so is not in any of the default library locations, add the
     the directory that contains libchemps2.so to the LD_LIBRARAY_PATH variable.
     For example::

        export LD_LIBRARAY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARAY_PATH:/some/path/that/contains/sofile

     This is usually the ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib64

   * If the include files are not installed in a default location, add it to the
     CPATH variable. For example::

        export CPATH=$CPATH:/some/path/that/contains/includefiles

     This is usually the ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include

3) Build the Python wrapper::

    python setup.py build_ext -L $LD_LIBRARY_PATH

4) Install the Python wrapper::

    python setup.py install

   You may want to select a non-standard location for the installation with the
   --user or --prefix option. If you do so, make sure the variables $PATH and
   $PYTHONPATH are also correctly set.

5) Run the tests::

    cd tests
    python test1.py
    python test2.py
    python test3.py
    python test4.py
    python test5.py
    python test6.py
    python test7.py
    python test8.py
    python test9.py
